					<a href="#Projects">CSC494 fall-winter 2017 - Capstone Project</a>
				</p>		
				<div>
					<p>
							Contributibuted as an Android and full stack web developer to accomplish the following features of the Project.
						</p>
					<div class="half_left_container">
						<h3>Features</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Display workplace health and safety content.</li> 
							<li>Search through USW’s health and safety documentation.</li> 
							<li>Provide members a way to give feedback.</li>
							<li>Support English and French languages</li>
							<li>Add content though an administrator page</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					</div>
				</div>

				<div style="clear:both;">
					<h3>Challenges</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Open ended problem. What key components are important for a beta release  for the given period of time?</li>
							<li>Team of 6 people with different backgrounds.</li>
							<li>Learn to work with a multidisciplinary team.</li>
							<li>Bilingual App where French is not the teams first language.</li>
						</ul>
					<h3>Collaboration</h3>
					<p>
						From the beginning until the end of the project, i had to collaborate with United Steel Workers to gather their requirements and refine as often as needed. 
					</p>

					<h3>Personal Experience</h3>
					<p>
						Although working with people with different backgrounds is interesting and exciting, it can be difficult to communicate information or coordinate tasks because not everyone in the team was familiar with the technical terms and technologies used in the project, as a result, development was slow and the tasks accumulated to the point that a feature had to be cut out from the project.
					</p>
					<p>
						CSC494/APS490 was a great opportunity to have real world experience with a client. It started with gathering information to creating the first, second and third prototype. Finally after many iterations with the client, we delivered the app to the client. I hope that with the development of the app, younge, new and existing workers become more aware of the potential hazards in their workplace.
					</p>
					<p>
						The key skills that i learned from this experience were:
						<ul>
							<li>Analyze business requirements</li>
							<li>Create prototypes for fast decision making</li>
							<li>Evaluate critical decision to convey to the team in simple words</li>
							<li>Improved organizational and analytical skills</li>

					</ul>

			</p>
			<p> Design a scheduler that allows prioritization of tasks based on user's input
				Prioritization is mainly based on number of hours needed, weight, and the deadline of the task.

				<br><br>The application recommends a recommendation of which tasks need to be worked on, through an ordered list. It aids the user in giving a clear view of the comparison of users' tasks and deadlines.
